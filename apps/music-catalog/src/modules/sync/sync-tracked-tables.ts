/**
 * Which MusicBrainz tables feed a Recording's search document, and how the
 * affected Recordings are found from a changed row. The worker installs one
 * trigger per entry (see `buildSyncTriggersSql`), which writes the Recording
 * ids to the outbox; the drain then rebuilds their documents.
 *
 * To track another table, add one entry: the `selectNew` query sees the
 * changed row as `NEW` (the builder derives the `OLD` side for deletes and
 * for updates that move a row's linkage) and must return the columns
 * `recording_id` and `recording_mbid` of every Recording the change affects.
 * Tables whose columns only `getRecording` shows live (isrcs, release dates
 * and countries, cover art, release group names, link type names) have no
 * entry: nothing they change is in the index, and the summaries searches
 * show are read from Postgres at query time.
