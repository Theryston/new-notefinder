# apps/web — Next.js frontend

Read the root `CLAUDE.md` first; this file only adds web-specific rules.

Stack: Next.js 16 (App Router, **Cache Components** enabled), React 19,
Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui (`base-nova` style on **Base UI**, not Radix),
next-intl, TanStack Query, react-hook-form + Zod, nuqs, Zustand, lucide-react.

**Top priority: speed.** Every page should feel instant. Prefer a prerendered
static shell + streamed dynamic holes over anything that blocks on a request.
If a change makes a page slower or grows the client bundle, justify it.

This Next.js version differs from your training data (`proxy.ts` instead of
`middleware.ts`, `'use cache'`, `cacheLife`/`cacheTag`/`updateTag`,
two-argument `revalidateTag`, `next/root-params`, …). Check
`node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before using a Next API.

## Commands

```sh
nub run dev          # next dev on port 3000
nub run build        # production build (also validates prerendering)
nub run check-types  # next typegen + tsc
nub run lint
nub run test         # Vitest unit tests (*.test.ts)
nub run test:cov     # unit tests + coverage thresholds (report in coverage/)
nub run test:watch
nub run test:e2e     # Playwright against `next start` (see Testing)
nub run bundle:check # first-load JS per page vs the budget (after build)
nub run lighthouse   # Lighthouse CI on the production build (after build)
```

```

- Route files (`page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `loading.tsx`) stay **thin**: read
  params, call feature fetchers, compose feature components. No business logic
  or big JSX trees in `app/`.
- A feature may import from `components/`, `hooks/`, `lib/` and other
  features' public components; avoid circular feature dependencies.
- `features/<f>/queries.ts` and anything touching secrets import
  `'server-only'`; client hooks/stores start with `'use client'` where needed.

## Legacy routes (no 404s)

This app replaces the legacy notefinder web app on the same domain. **Every
legacy URL must keep working**: either the route still exists or it
redirects to the new one. Preserve dynamic segments
(IDs, usernames) and query params. Since IDs are kept by the data import,
`/tracks/<id>` must land on the same track.

Because every new route is under `[locale]`, a bare legacy path like
`/tracks/abc` is redirected by `proxy.ts` to `/<detected-locale>/tracks/abc`
(see i18n below). That redirect depends on the visitor, so it is a temporary
**307** and must not be cached as a shared response by the CDN. When a route
is renamed, add an explicit **permanent (308)** redirect from the old path to
the new one (in `next.config.ts` `redirects()`, or in `proxy.ts` if it needs
logic) and list it below.

Legacy public routes (source: `app/` in
<https://github.com/theryston/notefinder>) and their current status:

| Legacy route | Query params | New route |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | | `/[locale]` |
| `/search` | `q` | `/[locale]/search` |
| `/tracks/[id]` | | `/[locale]/tracks/[trackId]` |
| `/artists/[id]` | | `/[locale]/artists/[artistId]` |
| `/albums/[id]` | | `/[locale]/albums/[albumId]` |
| `/users/[username]` | | `/[locale]/users/[username]` |
| `/me/edit` | | `/[locale]/me/edit` |
| `/sign-in` | `redirectTo` | `/[locale]/sign-in` |
| `/sign-up` | `redirectTo` | `/[locale]/sign-up` |
| `/verify-email` | | `/[locale]/verify-email` |
| `/forgot-password` | | `/[locale]/forgot-password` |
| `/forgot-password/reset` | `email` | `/[locale]/forgot-password/reset` |
| `/setup-username` | `redirectTo` | `/[locale]/setup-username` |
| `/terms` | | `/[locale]/terms` |
| `/sitemap.xml` | | `/sitemap.xml` |
| `/tracks/sitemap/[...path]` | | keep, or redirect to the new sitemap |
| `/artists/sitemap/[...path]` | | keep, or redirect to the new sitemap |
| `/albums/sitemap/[...path]` | | keep, or redirect to the new sitemap |

Keep this table up to date whenever a route is added, renamed or removed,
and mirror it in `e2e/legacy-routes.ts`: every legacy URL is checked to
redirect to its locale-prefixed equivalent (path and query kept). When a
route ships, flip its `implemented` flag (with a sample ID that resolves) so
the test also asserts the final page is not a 404.

## Rendering, data fetching and cache

**Server first.** Components are Server Components unless they need state,
effects, browser APIs or event handlers. Put `'use client'` on the smallest
leaf possible and pass server-fetched data down as props.

### Server (initial render)

- All server reads go through `lib/api` (typed fetch wrapper around `API_URL`)
  and are parsed with the `@notefinder/contracts` schemas. Errors surface as a
  typed `ApiError` (envelope `{ statusCode, code, message }`).
- Feature fetchers in `features/<f>/queries.ts` use `'use cache'` +
  `cacheTag(...)` + `cacheLife(...)`. Tag names come from the shared tag
  builders in `@notefinder/contracts` (the API invalidates the same tags).
- Public data (tracks, notes, artists, home sections): `'use cache'` (use
  `'use cache: remote'` for data that must be shared across instances in
  production). Pick the longest `cacheLife` that is still correct; freshness
  comes from tag invalidation, not short lifetimes.
- User-specific data: never read `cookies()`/`headers()` inside a shared cache.
  Either extract the user id and pass it into a cached function, or use
  `'use cache: private'`. Anything that reads the request sits behind
  `<Suspense>` so the rest of the page stays in the static shell.
- Every `<Suspense>` fallback is a skeleton with the **same dimensions** as the
  final content (zero layout shift).
- Use `generateStaticParams` for locales and for the most popular tracks so
  hot pages are prerendered at build time.
- Invalidation: after a mutation made from the web, use `updateTag` (in a
  server action) for read-your-own-writes; changes made elsewhere are
  invalidated by the API calling `app/api/revalidate` (`revalidateTag(tag,
  'max')`).

### Client (interactions)

- Client-side server state uses **TanStack Query** only (never `useEffect` +
  `fetch`). Hooks in `features/<f>/hooks/use-*.ts`, keys from
  `features/<f>/query-keys.ts`. The browser calls the API directly via the
  `lib/api` browser client (`credentials: 'include'`).
- Use it for things that change after load: favorite toggle, track processing
  status polling, search-as-you-type, streak heartbeat. Prefer optimistic
  updates for toggles.
- When a client component needs data the server already has, prefetch on the
  server and pass it via `HydrationBoundary` (or as `initialData`) so there is
  no loading flash.

### Performance checklist

- `next/image` with correct `sizes` for all images; `next/font` for fonts.
- Heavy client-only libraries (YouTube player, Tone.js, pitch detection,
  Lottie) are loaded with dynamic `import()` only on the pages that need them.
- Keep client components small; check the bundle impact of new dependencies.
  **Bundle budget**: `nub run bundle:check` (after `nub run build`, also in
  CI) fails when a prerendered page's first-load JS exceeds
  `MAX_FIRST_LOAD_KIB` (gzipped) in `scripts/bundle-budget.ts`. Fix it with
  dynamic `import()`, a smaller dependency or moving work to the server;
  raising the budget needs the reason in the PR.
- **Lighthouse** (`nub run lighthouse`, in CI after the e2e tests): every
  page in `lighthouserc.cjs` must score ≥ 90 performance and ≥ 95
  accessibility, best practices and SEO, with LCP ≤ 2.5 s, TBT ≤ 200 ms and
  CLS ≤ 0.1 (desktop, median of 3 runs). Add each new public page to its
  `url` list (with a sample ID that resolves). Locally, point `CHROME_PATH`
  at a Chrome/Chromium binary if none is installed.
- No request waterfalls: start independent fetches in parallel
  (`Promise.all`) or in sibling Suspense boundaries.
- **Shared cache**: `cache-handlers/redis.ts` backs both `'use cache'` and
  `'use cache: remote'` (in-process LRU in front of Redis). With
  `CACHE_REDIS_URL` set, every instance shares entries and tag invalidations
  reach all instances within ~1 s (prerendered pages included); without it
  (local dev, CI, `next build`) Next's default in-memory cache is used. Redis
  being down degrades to the local tier, never to errors. So plain
  `'use cache'` is already shared; no need to reach for `remote`.
- `cache-handlers/*.ts` is imported by Next natively (Node type stripping,
  not bundled): relative imports with the `.ts` extension, only erasable
  TypeScript syntax, no `@/` aliases and no `server-only`. It relies on Next
  internals (`createDefaultCacheHandler`, the tags manifest): **re-check it
  (and its tests) whenever Next is upgraded** (`next` is pinned exactly).

## i18n (next-intl)

- Locales: `en` and `pt-BR`, always in the URL (`/en/...`, `/pt-BR/...`).
  Routing config in `lib/i18n/`, locale detection/redirect in `proxy.ts`.
- `proxy.ts` is **custom** (next-intl's middleware can't detect by country and
  sets cookies on prefixed paths). It must never set cookies or redirect on
  paths that already have a locale, so static pages stay CDN-cacheable.
  Detection logic lives in plain functions in `lib/i18n/detect-locale.ts`.
- The locale is read from `next/root-params` in `lib/i18n/request.ts` (don't
  use `setRequestLocale`). Route Handlers and Server Actions can't read root
  params: pass `{ locale }` explicitly to next-intl there.
- `en` is the **source of truth** for messages, not the locale everyone gets.
  A request without a locale prefix is redirected to the visitor's locale,
  resolved in this order:
  1. the locale the user picked before (next-intl locale cookie);
  2. the user's location: the country header set by the CDN/proxy (e.g.
     `cf-ipcountry`), mapped to a supported locale (`BR`, `PT`, `AO`, `MZ` →
     `pt-BR`, …);
  3. the browser's `Accept-Language`;
  4. `en` when none of the above matches a supported locale.
- The locale switcher lets users override it and stores the choice in the
  cookie. Once a URL has a locale prefix, that locale is always respected (no
  auto-redirect away from it), so shared links and crawlers get stable pages.
- **No hard-coded user-visible strings** — including `alt`, `aria-label`,
  `title`, placeholders, toasts, metadata and validation messages.
- Messages are namespaced by feature (`tracks.overview.title`,
  `common.actions.save`). Add every key to **both** `en.json` and `pt-BR.json`
  in the same change. Keys are typed (next-intl `AppConfig` augmentation), so a
  missing/typo key fails `check-types`; `lib/i18n/messages.test.ts` fails when
  a locale's keys differ from `en`, a message is empty, or an API error code
  has no `errors.<CODE>` message.
- Use ICU placeholders and plurals; never concatenate translated fragments.
  Format dates, numbers and durations with next-intl's formatter, not manually.
- API errors are translated by their `code` (`errors.NOT_FOUND`, …), never by
  showing the API `message`.
- Metadata is translated. The locale layout sets title template and
  description and `metadataBase` (from `getSiteUrl()`), so the relative
  URLs each page sets become absolute; **each page** sets hreflang/canonical
  with `localeAlternates(locale, path)` from `lib/i18n/metadata.ts` (a layout
  doesn't know the current path).
- Only the message namespaces client components need are passed to
  `NextIntlClientProvider` (currently `errors`); add namespaces deliberately
  to keep the RSC payload small.

## UI and styling

- shadcn/ui components are added with `nub exec shadcn add <component>` and
  then formatted with `nub run format`. Customize via variants/`className` or
  wrap them in `components/`; avoid rewriting their internals.
- Follow the design system in the root `DESIGN.md` (pill controls,
  `rounded-2xl` surfaces, `glass` floating layers, Figtree, Lucide at 1.75
  stroke, spring motion). `components/ui/button.tsx` is already adapted to it.
- Tailwind v4 with the design tokens in `app/globals.css`. Use theme tokens
  (`bg-background`, `text-muted-foreground`, …), not raw hex colors or
  arbitrary values, unless there is no token for it. Dark mode via
  `next-themes` (class strategy) must work on every screen.
- Merge classes with `cn()`; component variants with `cva`.
- Accessible by default: semantic HTML, keyboard navigable, visible focus,
  labels for inputs, `alt` for images.
- Mobile-first: every screen must work on small screens (the timeline in
  landscape/fullscreen, as in the original app).

## Forms and client state

- Forms: react-hook-form + `zodResolver` using the **contracts schema** of the
  endpoint being called. Validation messages are i18n keys mapped from the
  Zod issue, not hard-coded text. Show API error codes translated.
- State placement:
  - server data → TanStack Query (client) or props (server);
  - URL state (search query, filters, tabs, pagination) → `nuqs`;
  - local UI state → `useState`/`useReducer`;
  - complex shared client state (player/timeline: playback time, transpose,
    speed, mic on/off, detected pitch) → a Zustand store in
    `features/<f>/stores/`, read through selectors.
- High-frequency values (current playback time, pitch at 60 fps) must not
  re-render React trees: keep them in refs/store subscriptions and draw with
  `requestAnimationFrame`/canvas.
- No React Context for frequently changing state.

## Auth

- Better Auth lives in the API. The client is `getAuthClient()` in
  `lib/auth/client.ts` (`better-auth/react` with the `emailOTP` and
  `username` plugins) for sign up/in/out, OTP verification, password reset
  and setting the username. Its responses use Better Auth's format, not
  `ApiError`: translate its error codes through i18n too
  (`features/auth/auth-error.ts`, `authErrors.<CODE>`).
- Keep auth pages inside the bundle budget: load the client on demand with
  `loadAuthClient()` (`features/auth/auth-client.ts`) instead of importing
  it, wrap calls in `authRequest()` (a thrown network error becomes a
  returned one), validate forms with `lazyResolver()` (Zod loads on the first
  validation) and import plain constants from
  `@notefinder/contracts/auth-rules`, which has no Zod.
- The session on the client is a TanStack query (`sessionUserOptions()` in
  `features/auth/session.ts`: a plain `GET /v1/auth/get-session`, `null` when
  signed out), not Better Auth's `useSession()`. Update it after anything
  that changes the session (verify email, set username, sign out), or
  screens reading it act on stale data.
- **Onboarding gate**: `AuthGate` (in the locale layout) sends a signed-in
  user with an unverified email to `/verify-email`, then one without a
  username to `/setup-username`, from any page, keeping where they were
  going in `redirectTo`. It runs in the browser so pages stay static;
  signed-out visitors are never redirected. Those steps always offer "Sign
  out", and changing the email signs out first. The rule is
  `requiredAuthStep()` in `features/auth/auth-gate.ts`.
- On the server, `getCurrentUser()` from `lib/auth/session.ts` calls
  `GET /v1/me` forwarding the request cookies (deduplicated per request) and
  returns `null` when signed out.
- Session-dependent UI (avatar in the header, "favorite" state) is rendered
  inside `<Suspense>` so it never blocks the static shell.

## Env

- `lib/env/server.ts` (`server-only`: `API_URL`, `REVALIDATE_SECRET`) and
  `lib/env/client.ts` (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`) validate env with Zod. They are
  read on demand and checked at server start by `instrumentation.ts`, so
  `next build` needs no secrets. Server-only values never get the
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix.
- `CACHE_REDIS_URL` (optional, server-only) enables the shared Redis cache;
  it's read by `cache-handlers/redis.ts` and also validated in
  `lib/env/server.ts`. Production: set it on **every** web instance, use a
  Redis with `maxmemory-policy volatile-lru` (so tag keys are never evicted)
  and persistence, and ship `cache-handlers/` next to `.next/` in the image.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are inlined at build time: the Docker build must
  receive them as build args. That includes `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`
  (`getSiteUrl()`, default `http://localhost:3000`), which static pages bake
  into canonical/hreflang URLs; a production build without it logs a warning.

## Testing

- Vitest for pure logic: `*.test.ts` next to the file (timeline math, note
  conversion, pitch detection, formatters, API client parsing).
- Playwright for critical flows in `e2e/`: search → open track, track page
  playback/timeline, sign up/in, favorite. It runs against a **production
  build** with `next start` on port 3000, using the dummy env in
  `e2e/web-server-env.ts`. From the repo root, `nub run test:e2e` builds web
  first (Turbo); running it inside `apps/web` uses whatever `.next` is on disk,
  so rebuild (or delete `.next`) after switching branches.
- Chromium: CI runs `playwright install`. Machines with a preinstalled
  Chromium that doesn't match the pinned `@playwright/test` set
  `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH` (Claude Code cloud sessions get it
  from `.claude/hooks/session-start.sh`).
